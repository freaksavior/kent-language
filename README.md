# kent-language
The well-intentioned, but unintentionally carcinogenic scripting language.

In the late 1940's and '50's, the world was starting to learn that setting aflame a small pile of tar and breathing in the fumes was harmful to humans health. Cigarette companies, in response, attempted to create safer cigarettes. One such attempt was the Kent, which tasted the same, but cut 80% of tar! You might wonder what was wrong with them.

The filters were made of asbestos.

I approach the design of this language with no doubt the same honest, good intentions, and no ulterior motives... and despite my well-meaning, it will probably give everyone cancer.
