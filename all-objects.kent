# These are functionally the same.

foo.a = 4;
foo.a = { return 4 };

# Note the lack of semicolon in the second example. It's not necessary
# because semicolons are a statement *SEPARATOR* rather than a statement
# *TERMINATOR*. My guideline will be, (unless I decide to go without
# semicolons) that you SHOULD only omit them in cases like these, where
# you have { ONE STATEMENT } on a single line.
